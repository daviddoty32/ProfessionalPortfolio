# Job Application Assistant

Hello!

This program is a favorite of mine. The Problem I faced was that each Job Application took me quite a bit of time to
process. I would need to update my resume to pick out my best skills, write a new
cover letter, etc. Even worse, the more I did, the more likely it was that I would make a mistake.
The solution? Get ChatGPT to write my cover letters and pick from my skills!

In this program I input the parameters for job listings from LinkedIn, Scrape the
HTML from the website using BeautifulSoup, extract some keywords from the job description
using YAKE, and send that information along with a carefully specific prompt to
ChatGPT using the OpenAI API. Then, I create the documents using PDF Canvas.

This has vastly improved my ability to quickly apply for new jobs. At the time of
writing, I have plans for more portfolio projects but this is the only one that
spawned organically from an actual need I had. As Applicant Tracking Systems 
filter through applicants more and more quickly, I've given myself the ability to
apply more and more quickly in response.

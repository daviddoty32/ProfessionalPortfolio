# The Problem with Planes

This project is purely hypothetical. Imagine: you are an air control operator. Usually, the radar systems in air control
towers and airplanes give information on both the
distance from an object and its direction. Let's imagine

me, so their products malfunction giving only
the distance from an object, but not its direction.
In this problem, I both simulate the flight path
of these planes, and display their postion.

# Animal Classifier

During the Thanksgiving Holiday, my sister was bragging about her 
toddler son, my godson. She was saying
that he was abnormally smart, being able to correctly identify the animals in 
his story books with about 75% accuracy. This annoyed me, as I am able to 
classify those animals with 100% percent accuracy while receiving absolutely
no credit for being able to do so. So, when my sister rudely said that 
my job would be replaced with AI, I decided to create an AI to replace her son.
I made this program to train an AI to classify animals from a dataset on Kaggle
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10). Note, I removed
Spiders from my own code here because I have a personal dislike for them, so
there are only 9 classes trained in my model.

As of the writing of this (Dec 22, 2023) I was able to achieve 75% accuracy,
easily replacing my nephew.

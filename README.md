# ProfessionalPortfolio

Howdy! My name is David Doty and if you're reading this, that means that I have applied for a job at your company and you are evaluating my work! First and foremost, let me thank you for taking the time to look at my work. I am very passionate about what I do and I am thrilled to share some of my capabilities with you. Secondly, you may notice that my cover letter seemed impersonal. That is because, well, it was. It's hard to convey personality and passion in a cover letter when job applicants need to apply to dozens or even hundreds of jobs to land one. To solve this issue for me, I delegated the responsibility of creating cover letters to a generative AI API so that I could apply more quickly. (You can see this program in the Job_Application_Assistant folder.) Therefore, treat this portfolio as my REAL cover letter. In my work, you will hopefully see the passion and joy I pour into both my software development and my data analysis. THIS is what you will get when you hire me to your organization.


Thank you so much,
Dave Doty

Note, I started this portfolio in December 2023. I will be adding projects periodically as I have time to work on them. If it looks a little bare when you visit, it could be because yours was one of the first positions I applied to!
